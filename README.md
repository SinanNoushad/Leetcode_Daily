# Daily Coding Challenge on LeetCode

Welcome to my Daily Coding Challenge repository! ðŸŽ¯

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges I solve daily on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms, and become more proficient in coding by tackling a new challenge every day.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is stored in a separate folder named after the date (in `YYYY-MM-DD` format). Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `Problem.md`: A markdown file with the problem description.
- `Solution.py`: The Python solution to the problem.
- `Explanation.md` (Optional): A detailed explanation of the approach and thought process behind the solution.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-daily-challenge.git
