Here's a sample README that you can use for your daily coding challenge work on LeetCode:

Daily Coding Challenge on LeetCode
Welcome to my Daily Coding Challenge repository! ðŸŽ¯

Overview
This repository contains solutions to various coding challenges I solve daily on LeetCode. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms, and become more proficient in coding by tackling a new challenge every day.

Structure
Each day's challenge is stored in a separate folder named after the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format). Inside each folder, you'll find:

Problem.md: A markdown file with the problem description.
Solution.py: The Python solution to the problem.
Explanation.md (Optional): A detailed explanation of the approach and thought process behind the solution.
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-daily-challenge.git
Navigate to the challenge of the day:
bash
Copy code
cd leetcode-daily-challenge/YYYY-MM-DD
Run the solution:
bash
Copy code
python Solution.py
Goals
Consistency: Solve at least one coding challenge every day.
Learning: Explore different problem types, algorithms, and data structures.
Documentation: Keep a record of problems and solutions for future reference.
Progress
